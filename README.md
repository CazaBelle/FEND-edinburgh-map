## Neighborhood Map Project

The Udacity Neighborhood Map project is the final project for the Front-end Web Development Nanodegree. The task was to create a Neighborhood Map from scratch using React. For this purpose, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The app allows users to discover some of the popular locations in Edinburgh, Scotland.  Users can interact with both the listed locations and map markers, and can search by entering queries. 

## Instructions for Use

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`

### APIs and Packages
As part of the project requirements, I used the [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) and * `create-react-app` package
